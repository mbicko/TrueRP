                <h1 class="heading">BASIC COMMUNITY AND SERVER RULES</h1>
                <p>
                        Players must be 18 or over to participate on any of the True RP game servers. No exceptions. (If you are gaming on this server, we assume that you are 18 and are not liable for any adult language or content you might come into contact with.) 
Do NOT DM staff for support or server questions! Open a support ticket so that the whole staff can see it and be available to help you, if you are in-game, do a /report to contact an admin. 
Frequent blatant rule breaking and/or being toxic overall will result in a ban. This is up to the discretion of the staff team. Be respectful of other players and this community. Don’t be a troll in-character just to bait/harass people. 
Harassment, racism, sexism, trolling/drama, must win attitudes or hateful speech of ANY kind will not be tolerated on Discord, any of our game servers or in players streaming chats. This includes any use of any variation of the “N” and “R” words in any capacity. Respect other members of this community, we’re providing a positive space to game, keep it that way.  
Be considerate of others’ roleplay! You should strive to make the best possible scenario for your fellow players. Interactions with all other players should be played to the benefit of ALL players roleplay experience. Win or lose, this is something we do for fun, when everyone is having fun we all win. 
Use of outside discord servers, private voice chats or third party voice communication while on FiveM is prohibited for in-character communication. When communicating with anyone in-server, please mute and communicate in the city so that everyone can hear you. In-character voice communication must be done in server, no exceptions.
Example: People are hanging out in the discord general chat while farming apart from each other in server. If you are talking to somebody in-server mute yourself or deafen to better immerse yourself in the roleplay scenario.
Attempts to find loopholes or skirting around the rules is not allowed and up to the discretion of the staff to decide punishment after deliberation for the aforementioned actions. 
Abusing game mechanics or exploits are prohibited on ANY of our servers. This will result in a permanent ban. Any game exploits should be reported to developers if found. 
No Griefing. Do not continually attack or target a player over and over again if a problem has already previously been resolved via RP. This can be considered as a form of harassment. 
If a rule has been broken, do not break character, finish the scenario first. Open a player report ticket once the scenario is finished, do not open a ticket mid-scenario. If something is urgent, continue the roleplay and /report a staff member. 
Ban evasion will not be tolerated. If you have been banned, you can ask a staff member to create a ban appeal ticket for you.
